The recording of the EP took place in Carson, California during the summer of 2013 with the help of her Top Dawg labelmate Isaiah Rashad, among others. A PBR&B and neo soul album, Z has a diverse musical style that incorporates contemporary urban genres such as soul, hip hop, and minimalist R&B, as well as 1980s synthpop elements. Its production is characterized by layers of sliced, delayed, and reversed vocals, which are synthetic and fluid. Its lyrics explore the complexities of romantic relationships, sexuality, nostalgia, and abandonment. The album was written by SZA herself, with production handled by Mac Miller, Emile Haynie and others. Upon release Z received generally positive reviews from music critics, who commended its production and musical style. Critics also praised the EP's lyrical content and SZA's vocals, as well as comparing the EP to the work of singer and songwriter Lorde.Z debuted on the US Billboard 200 at number thirty-nine, selling 6,980 copies in its opening week.

The album harnessed the talents of an illustrious coterie of producers and vocalists. Tshepo Tshola features on the rousing Ndilinde, Xhosa traditional vocalist Madosini lent her expertise on Lahl\u2019umlenze, Mandla Spikiri produced Kwanele, while the lush Transkei Moon and Ndizokulibala were jointly produced by local talent D-Rex and Bluey Maunick, founder and producer of the world-renowned band Incognito. Malambule, who also is the executive producer of the entire album, produces the rest of the songs. Released on Gallo Records Gallo World Vision (GWV) label, the album also saw Thandiswa becoming a central part of the entire recording project. From the production to imaging of the album cover, Thandiswa was involved in each phase of the process. The hand-picked band was selected from a range of musicians who participated in a three-day auditions process. Chosen from over 400 candidates, the new band brings a vibrant, fresh young sound to the performances. As additional preparation for the recording process, Thandiswa also embarked on a pilgrimage to her mothers home village in the Transkei, moving on to spend a fortnight in Mkhankato, Madosini\u2019s village in the heart of rural Transkei. Here she was exposed to the original sounds of Xhosa traditional melodies, and was introduced to the Uhadi, a traditional Xhosa one-string harp. Over the two weeks, Madosini imparted cultural wisdoms, explaining the philosophies inherent in the creation of Xhosa music respect for others and self, recognizing the spiritual realm as the true source of the music, and the key role of nature in the creation of music. The compositions range from traditional Xhosa rhythms, upbeat Mbaqanga, a touch of reggae, thumping kwaito and quasi-gospel sounds that are truly representative of this artists broad range. Thandiswa straddles the urban and the rural, and effortlessly melds the traditional with the modern. A child raised in South Africa\u2019s urban townships, her birthplace is rural Transkei, and in Zabalaza, she remains unfailingly loyal to both." }	, "releaseDate": { "type": "typed-literal", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date", "value": "2006-02-07" }	, "runtime": { "type": "typed-literal", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#double", "value": "62.8333" }},

The show was recorded at the San Francisco club The Purple Onion in June 2005. Galifianakis's routine features his trademark dry humor and a large portion of it is accompanied by a light piano piece played by him as bed music. It ends with him tearing off pages of a large pad of paper which contain pre-written, and largely self-deprecating, jokes, while the Pacific Boychoir sings \"The Greatest Love of All\". The DVD contains two separate sections which are cut to throughout the routine, often at times where the content of the routine may have to do with the content of the other portions. One of the sections is an unscripted roadtrip to The Purple Onion in a Volkswagen bus with Galifianakis and his friend Joe Wagner. The banter and happenings that occur seem to provide insights to where Galifianakis gets some of his comedy. The bus ends up breaking down just short of their goal so they finish the trip in a GoCar, a small rental vehicle meant for tourists. The second section is a loosely scripted interview of Galifianakis's brother \"Seth Galifianakis\" (played by Galifianakis) by Brian Unger. The DVD was released March 6, 2007." }},

The music on Zero Set is strongly influenced by African rhythms and music. One track, \"Recall\", features Sudanese vocals by Deuka. Matthew Weiner describes it for Soulmind Online: \"Though not a dance record per se, Zero Set is one of the earliest extensions of Krautrock\u2019s possibilities on the dance floor, pitting the profoundly electronic sequence patterns of Plank and Moebius against the hyperactive percussives of Guru Guru drummer Mani Neumeier. On tracks such as the prophetically titled 'Speed Display' and 'Pitch Control', the phasing, chattering and decidedly Germanic grooves found on Zero Set constitute vibrant proto-techno at its earliest and finest.\" David Ross Smith, writing for Allmusic, describes the album: \"...a highly percussive affair with Mani Neumeier. The album is saturated in drum and synth rhythms and polyrhythms, resulting in compositions that are energetic and infectious.\" Zero Set was a turning point for Moebius and Plank, a fact lamented by Steven and Alan Freeman in their book The Crack In The Cosmic Egg.

Rather than Metheny's standard reportoire of fusion jazz, Zero Tolerance for Silence consists of frantic, overdriven, intricately textured guitar soloing with occasionally distinguishable blues-like melodies. The album caused a division of opinion among listeners, who had not expected the formerly accessible Metheny to venture into the avant-garde. Some, including many of Metheny's most devoted fans, felt that the album was a cataclysmic artistic mistake, and fan forums have from time to time attempted to pressure Metheny into disowning the recording. He has declined to do so, although Geffen quietly allowed it to fall out of print towards the end of the 1990s. In a 2008 interview, Metheny was asked to respond to an internet rumor that the album was conceived as a \"'poke in the eye' to Geffen records\":That rumor was started by a journalist who was seriously not listening to the album. All it would have taken was a quick phone call [to me] to find out that that wasn't the case. Besides, I would never do something like that. It isn't the way I operate, which I think has been pretty self-evident over the years. That record speaks for itself in its own musical terms. To me, it is a 2-D view of a world in which I am usually functioning in a more 3-D way. It is entirely flat music, and that was exactly what it was intended to be. The cover carried an endorsement by Sonic Youth guitarist/singer Thurston Moore, hailing Metheny as a \"master\".

The zero flag is typically abbreviated Z or ZF or similar in most documentation and assembly languages. Along with a carry flag, a sign flag and an overflow flag, the zero flag is used to check the result of an arithmetic operation, including bitwise logical instructions. It is set if an arithmetic result is zero, and reset otherwise. This includes results which are not stored, as most traditional instruction sets implement the compare instruction as a subtract where the result is discarded. It is also common that processors have a bitwise AND-instruction that does not store the result. In most processors, the zero flag is mainly used in conditional branch instructions, which alter control flow on previous instruction results, but there are often other uses as well. In some instruction sets such as the MIPS architecture, a dedicated flag register is not used; jump instructions instead check a register for zero." }},

When the bond reaches maturity, its investor receives its par (or face) value. Examples of zero-coupon bonds include U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. savings bonds, long-term zero-coupon bonds, and any type of coupon bond that has been stripped of its coupons. In contrast, an investor who has a regular bond receives income from coupon payments, which are made semi-annually or annually. The investor also receives the principal or face value of the investment when the bond matures. Some zero coupon bonds are inflation indexed, so the amount of money that will be paid to the bond holder is calculated to have a set amount of purchasing power rather than a set amount of money, but the majority of zero coupon bonds pay a set amount of money known as the face value of the bond. Zero coupon bonds may be long or short term investments. Long-term zero coupon maturity dates typically start at ten to fifteen years. The bonds can be held until maturity or sold on secondary bond markets. Short-term zero coupon bonds generally have maturities of less than one year and are called bills.

His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. Zeus is the child of Cronus and Rhea, the youngest of his siblings to be born, though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging from Cronus's stomach. In most traditions, he is married to Hera, by whom he is usually said to have fathered Ares, Hebe, and Hephaestus. At the oracle of Dodona, his consort was said to be Dione, by whom the Iliad states that he fathered Aphrodite. Zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades. These resulted in many godly and heroic offspring, including Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Persephone, Dionysus, Perseus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, Minos, and the Muses. He was respected as an allfather who was chief of the gods and assigned the others to their roles: \"Even the gods who are not his natural children address him as Father, and all the gods rise in his presence.\" He was equated with many foreign weather gods, permitting Pausanias to observe \"That Zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men\". His symbols are the thunderbolt, eagle, bull, and oak. In addition to his Indo-European inheritance, the classical \"cloud-gatherer\" (Greek: \u039D\u03B5\u03C6\u03B5\u03BB\u03B7\u03B3\u03B5\u03C1\u03AD\u03C4\u03B1, Nephel\u0113gereta) also derives certain iconographic traits from the cultures of the Ancient Near East, such as the scepter.

The title of the album consists of a meaningless phrase made solely of four grammatical Chinese particles from Classical Chinese. The phrase functions as an adjective; if someone's Chinese is \"Zhi hu zhe ye\", it means it is stale and archaic. The album broadened the horizons of Chinese music and set a new model for Chinese songwriting. The album had four hit singles: the title song \"Zhi hu zhe ye\" (\u4E4B\u4E4E\u8005\u4E5F), \"Lukang, the Little Town\" (\u9E7F\u6E2F\u5C0F\u93AE), \"Love Song 1980\" (\u6200\u66F21980), and \"Childhood\" (\u7AE5\u5E74), previously sung by Sylvia Chang in her 1981 album Childhood. The singles from the album remain among Lo Ta-yu's best known songs in mainland China. Internationally, the album was released in 1982 as Selective Works of Lo Ta-yu (\u7F85\u5927\u4F51\u4F5C\u54C1\u9078) by Fontana Records with two additional tracks, \"Foolishly Waiting\" (\u75F4\u75F4\u7684\u7B49) and \"Deaf-Blind\" (\u76F2\u807E)." }	, "albumType": { "type": "typed-literal", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString", "value": "Studio" }},

Arising in the 17th century, zhungdra (zhung meaning \"center, mainstream\", and dra meaning \"music\") is an entirely endemic Bhutanese style associated with the folk music of the central valleys of Paro, Thimphu, and Punakha, the heart of the Ngalop cultural area. B\u00F6dra, in contrast, evolved out of Tibetan court music. Zhungdra is characterized by the use of extended vocal tones in complex patterns which slowly decorate a relatively simple instrumental melody. Untrained singers, even those with natural singing ability, typically find it challenging to sing zhungdra. This has reduced the popularity of zhungdra compared with rigsar, the fast-paced pop Bhutanese music style based on electronic synthesizers. The zhungdra style may be appreciated in songs such as Lhodrak Marpai Zhab, found on Jigme Drukpa's album Endless Songs from Bhutan. Although formally secular, the lyrics of zhungdra songs often tell Buddhist allegories, such as Yak Legbi Lhadar, in which the singer tells of his former life as a yak slaughtered in connection with a non-Buddhist ritual in the Gasa district." }},

In the Zig-Zag illusion, a magician divides an assistant into thirds, only to have them emerge from the illusion at the end of the performance completely unharmed. Since its invention in the mid-1960s by magician Robert Harbin, it has been hailed as one of the greatest illusions ever invented due to both the apparent impossibility of the trick, and the fact that unlike many illusions it can be performed surrounded by spectators and withstand the scrutiny of audience members. Harbin was frustrated by his illusion being pirated by other magicians and this inspired him to publish the method in his book The Magic of Robert Harbin in 1970. The book was limited to 500 copies and owners of the book were granted permission to build or have built the Zig Zag Girl (or indeed any other of the items in the book). The rights to the book and the Zig Zag illusion were then in time passed to The Magic Circle in the wake of Harbin's death. The concept of dividing a lady assistant in two or three parts was something that Harbin experimented with throughout his career before creating his ultimate divide, the Zig Zag Girl. Evidence of his fascination with this concept of dividing an assistant can be found in his earlier publications and the closest relative to the Zig Zag is the \"Little by Little\" which was also explained in The Magic of Robert Harbin.

Townsend describes the album as a mix between Strapping Young Lad and The Devin Townsend Band, with a storyline like that of Punky Br\u00FCster's Cooked on Phonics. The album is a solo album, with all music written, mixed, produced and performed by Townsend. All drum tracks were produced with EZdrummer, a software drum machine, using the Drumkit from Hell expansion. Townsend played a world exclusive ZTO concert in Tuska Open Air Metal Festival in Helsinki on July 2, 2010, where the whole Ziltoid album was played, with a regular Devin Townsend Project set the next day. Townsend plans to begin a series of online videos, a series titled ZTV, in which a Ziltoid hand puppet conducts interviews with various bands. Townsend had stated that he was planning to release a sequel album called Z\u00B2, but plans for the album were later supposedly scrapped when he stated, \"I'm very rapidly realizing that humor and metal... it doesn't really work.\" However, he later posted on his Twitter account, stating that the \"record is vying for pole-position currently.\" In 2014, Townsend announced the recording of Z\u00B2, making the album official. The recording of Z\u00B2 started in May 2014, and the album was released on October 27, 2014." }	, "releaseDate": { "type": "typed-literal", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date", "value": "2007-05-21" }	, "albumType": { "type": "typed-literal", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString", "value": "studio" }	, "runtime": { "type": "typed-literal", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#double", "value": "53.7667" }},

Jobson's credits for the album include keyboards, violins, and vocals. This album is notable for the fact that it contains Jobson's first (and only) lead vocal performance (although previous efforts with Roxy Music and Zappa had him on backing vocals). The album also features ex-Gentle Giant guitarist Gary Green on some tracks along with other musicians loosely referred to as 'Zinc'. The album was re-released on CD during the 1990s by One Way Records, but is currently out of print. The album features a mostly synthesiser based synthpop / progressive rock sound and is a concept album of sorts, with the lyrics centring on a somewhat Orwellian dystopic future society where everything is tinted green. At the end of the song \"Listen to Reason\" Jobson sings the line \"Green is now, Pink is next\". However, no \"Pink Album\" was ever recorded, even if it was planned. Jobson instead went on to record the album Theme of Secrets (1985) on the Private Music label. Demo versions of \"Easy for You to Say\", \"Listen to Reason\" and \"Green Face\" have been leaked to the public, and appear on some bootlegs. \"Nostalgia\" and \"Walking from Pastel\" were included (although in slightly different versions) in UK's last tour and do appear on some bootlegs.

Co-produced by Cooper and his bassist at the time, Erik Scott, Zipper Catches Skin is musically known for its dry and energetic hard rock style, with pop punk and post-punk influences and less emphasis on hard riffs, carrying on a similar musical direction of the preceding Special Forces with sonically slicker and clearer results. Lyrically, Cooper employed a much stronger focus on comical sarcasm and on avoiding using clich\u00E9d subject matter. Erik Scott has stated the album \u201Cwas meant to be lean, stripped down, and low on frills. Punkish and bratty.\u201D However, although it saw the return of guitarist Dick Wagner to Cooper\u2019s band, Zipper is generally not considered to be up to the same standard as his previous works. Despite its first single \u201CI Am the Future\u201D being featured in the film Class of 1984 as its theme song, and The Waitresses\u2019 Patty Donahue appearing on its other single \u201CI Like Girls\u201D, Zipper Catches Skin failed to chart in most countries, including in the US where it became Cooper\u2019s first album to not dent the Billboard Top 200 since Easy Action. The album\u2019s inconspicuous front cover, featuring just the album\u2019s lyrics with a smear of blood rather than exploiting the vivid imagery suggestive of the album\u2019s title, did not help the situation. At the time, Cooper described Zipper Catches Skin as \u201Ctotally kill. Real hardcore. The stuff that I do has always been a lot like that. In fact, I invented a couple of songs that were remakes of other songs, just for the purpose of attacking clich\u00E9s. There are no clich\u00E9s on this album, and I did that for a specific reason. Rock and roll right now is jammed with clich\u00E9s.\u201D Cooper described the photograph of him on the album\u2019s back cover as \u201Cvery Haggar slacks. I look good. I look like a GQ ad, only I\u2019m zipping up my pants and you can see definite pain on my face.\"\u201D Dick Wagner, who left halfway through the recording sessions, described Zipper Catches Skin as \u201Cthe off to the races speedy album\u201D and a \u201Cdrug induced nightmare\u201D. Wagner later revealed in a segment of the Deleted Scenes on the 2014 documentary film Super Duper Alice Cooper that Alice was smoking crack cocaine at the time and had a curtain set up behind the recording mic with a stool on it where he kept his crack pipe; he and other members of the band would sneak behind the curtain to take hits in between recording takes. Zipper Catches Skin is the second of three albums which Alice refers to as his \u201Cblackout\u201D albums, the others being the preceding album, Special Forces, and the following album, DaDa, as he has no recollection of recording them, due to the substance abuse, although he did manage to film a TV advert intended to promote Zipper at the time. Cooper stated \u201CI wrote them, recorded them and toured them and I don\u2019t remember much of any of that\u201D, though he actually toured only Special Forces. There was no tour to promote Zipper, and none of its songs have ever been played live." }	, "releaseDate": { "type": "typed-literal", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date", "value": "1982-08-25" }	, "runtime": { "type": "typed-literal", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#double", "value": "32.4167" }},

Parts of the album, like the tracks \"Blah Blah Caf\u00E9\" and the second half of the track \"Diva\", were reworkings of material that had already appeared as sections of the album Music for Supermarkets, released the previous year. The track \"Moon Machine\" was recorded for inclusion on Zoolook but did not appear on the final release; it later appeared, first on a flexidisc included with Keyboard Magazine (March 1986 issue), the 12-inch single of the Special Remix of \"Fourth Rendez-Vous\" (1986), and the much later Images compilation album (1991). The voices heard on this album were based on recordings of speech and singing in numerous languages: Aboriginal, Afghan, Arabic, Balinese, Buhndi, Chinese, Dutch (Ethnicolor II - 3:15), English, Eskimo, French, German, Hungarian, Indian, Japanese, Malagasy, Malayan, Pygmy, Polish, Quechua, Russian, Sioux, Spanish, Swedish, Tibetan and Turkish. The album spawned two singles: the title track and \"Zoolookologie\". Both were released in remixed forms as both 7\" and 12\" singles, the latter format including extended remixes by Fran\u00E7ois Kevorkian. A further extended remix version of \"Zoolook\", produced by Razormaid!, has also been released. After the initial album release, subsequent ones for Polydor and Dreyfus in 1985 included these remixed 7\" versions as the canonical album tracks (see track listings below).

McCoy has stated that the album was in development hell for several years due to restrictions from the record label. The album is dedicated to Scarlett McCoy, Carl McCoy's daughter.

Produced by Flood, Brian Eno, and The Edge, it was released on 5 July 1993 on Island Records. Inspired by the band's experiences on the Zoo TV Tour, Zooropa expanded on many of the tour's themes of technology and media oversaturation. The record was a continuation of the group's experimentation with alternative rock, electronic dance music, and electronic sound effects that began with their previous album, Achtung Baby, in 1991. U2 began writing and recording Zooropa in Dublin in February 1993, during a six-month break between legs of the Zoo TV Tour. The record was originally intended as an EP to promote the \"Zooropa\" leg of the tour that was to begin in May 1993, but during the sessions, the group decided to extend the record to a full-length LP. Pressed for time, U2 wrote and recorded at a rapid pace, with songs originating from many sources, including leftover material from the Achtung Baby sessions. The album was not completed in time for the tour's resumption, forcing the band to travel between Dublin and their tour destinations in May to complete mixing and recording. Zooropa received generally favourable reviews from critics. Despite none of its three singles\u2014\"Numb\", \"Lemon\", and \"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\"\u2014being hits consistently across regions, the record sold well upon release and peaked at number one in multiple countries. The album's charting duration and lifetime sales of 7 million copies, however, were less than those of Achtung Baby. In 1994, Zooropa won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. Although the record was a success and music journalists view the album as one of the group's most creative works, the band regard it with mixed feelings." }	, "releaseDate": { "type": "typed-literal", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date", "value": "1993-07-05" }	, "albumType": { "type": "typed-literal", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString", "value": "album" }	, "runtime": { "type": "typed-literal", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#double", "value": "51.25" }},

The album was credited on the front cover to \"Dean Elliott and His Swinging Big, Big Band\" and on the LP label to \"Dean Elliott and His Orchestra\". The album was made with the assistance of Phil Kaye, a sound effects virtuoso who worked with Elliott on the Tom and Jerry cartoons. The subtitle that appeared on the front cover of the LP (which also featured three young women striking arguably sultry poses with saxophones and congas atop a cement truck) captured the basic goals, sound, and feel of the album quite well: A Sonic Spectacular Presenting MUSIC!

The LP is now firmly ensconced in the pantheon of \"space age pop\" or lounge classics, having been cited in RE/Search #14: Incredibly Strange Music (1993) which played a large part in the lounge revival of the 1990s. A track from the album (\"Will You Still Be Mine\") was later anthologized on one of Rhino Records' influential Cocktail Mix CDs. As the space age pop/lounge revival grew in popularity, two more tracks from the album (\"You're the Top\" and \"The Lonesome Road\") were anthologized on one of the many volumes of Capitol Records' Ultra-Lounge series. The album was out of print for many years and was not available officially on CD until recently. A bootleg version is available as a single disc that combines Zounds! What Sounds! with Jack Fascinato's Music From A Surplus Store (1958), another orchestral album with sound effects from the same period with a similar flavor.

The album title translates to English as \"Two - Easter egg\". Zwei-Osterei was recorded on February 23, 1970 at Rhenus-Studio, Gordorf, Germany. Zwei-Osterei was released in 1971 on the Schwann label, with a plastic embossed cover, including two multi fold-out inserts. Only 300 copies of the original LP were pressed and sold. The trio played piano, guitar, cello, flute, percussion, and organ, all of which were electronically treated by engineer Konrad (Conny) Plank. According to Conrad Schnitzler in a 1980 interview he gave to David Elliott an advertisement by an organist interested in new music led to the recording session being sponsored by a church. Kluster was required to add religious text to the first side of the album to obtain this sponsorship. The text was read by Manfred Paethe. The text was written by Rudolf Bohren, Kurt Marti, Dorothee Solle, Rudolf Otto Weimer, Lisolette Rauner and Hilde Domin. Schnitzler describes the text: \"If you don't understand the German words, it sounds better. [...] If you know what it means, you'll find it terrible.\" CD copies of Zwei-Osterei first appeared in record stores in 1994. These early copies were issued by the dubious reportedly Luxembourg-based Germanofon label, who produced numerous unauthorized and illegal (bootleg) Krautrock reissues and managed to get them into mainstream distribution. The Germanofon CDs were transcribed from well worn vinyl and have inferior sound quality. These bootlegs also incorrectly named the band Cluster. The album was first legally reissued on the U.S. based Hypnotic label in 1996 with new cover art and a sticker touting Cluster and Conrad Schnitzler's previous membership in Tangerine Dream. This CD reissue also contains a 15-minute-long bonus track from the 1980 Cluster & Farnbauer release Live In Vienna. The album was also reissued on the Japanese Captain Trip label on April 20, 2007 as a 450 copy limited CD edition with an adaption of the original cover art and a bonus track by Schnitzler's later band Eruption, Cold Winter, from their 1971 sessions.

The CD was re-released in 2003 with five bonus tracks. \"Av\u00F4hai\" was composed as a tribute to Ramalho's grandfather, who adopted him after his father died by drowning two years after he was born. Ramalho said that inspiration for the song came after an experience with psilocybin mushrooms in a friend's farm. He looked at the sky and saw the \"shadow of a gigantic spaceship\", and a voice whispered \"Av\u00F4hai\" in his ear. He was in that farm for a college work. \"Av\u00F4hai\" comes from the words \"Av\u00F4\" (grandfather) and \"Pai\" (father). The song marked the first time he listened to his own work on the radio, when he was in a taxi.

The album garnered the highest average reviews of all three trilogy albums, receiving generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its dynamic style and catchy songs; others found its music dull and observed filler on the album. It debuted at number nine on the US Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 69,000 copies in the United States, a low for the band, becoming their first album since signing to a major record label to not sell 100,000 records in its first week." }	, "releaseDate": { "type": "typed-literal", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date", "value": "2012-11-09" }	, "albumType": { "type": "typed-literal", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString", "value": "studio" }	, "runtime": { "type": "typed-literal", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#double", "value": "39.35" }},

Roberto Garc\u00EDa left Avalanch after the release of El \u00C1ngel Ca\u00EDdo due to personal and professional problems with Alberto Rionda. He had always worked as guitarist, but WarCry needed a bassist after Jard\u00F3n's departure at the end the band's last concert from El Sello De Los Tiempos Tour, so he decided to handle bass duties in order to become a member. The album was released in digipak format, as CD-DVD. The DVD contained a music video of the song \"Contra El Viento\", an interview to the band members, some of the recording sessions in the studio, and more. All the songs were composed by frontman, lead singer, and songwriter V\u00EDctor Garc\u00EDa. The album was well received by critics and mostly by fans, being considered as \"WarCry's heaviest album to date\" (the previous ones were power metal). Francisco Fonseca of Metal Archives described the record as \"catchy, with almost no fast drumming, lots of good riffs, choruses in every song, ballads, and metal fusions.\" The lyrics of this work deal with agony, fantasy, but most of all, with social issues, such as abuse, crime, and discrimination. \u00BFD\u00F3nde Est\u00E1 La Luz?

The album is marked by its funkiness and its mix of Brazilian, African, and American musical styles, and it is one of Ben's best-known recordings. Opening track \"Ponta de Lan\u00E7a Africano (Umbabarauma)\", a song about an African striker, became a well known football-associated track. It was included on David Byrne's 1989 compilation Brazil Classics Beleza Tropical, prompting rotation of a video for the track on VH-1. In 1991 Ambitious Lovers released a cover version on 12-inch single that became a dance hit. A version by Soulfly was released in 1998 as a single. The original version of the track was used in the documentary film Di/Glauber. British rock singer Rod Stewart used a melody from \"Taj Mahal\" in his hit song \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\". Ben filed a plagiarism lawsuit against Stewart, the upshot of which was Stewart's agreement to donate his royalties from the song to UNICEF.

An album of pop, soft rock and disco compositions, It showcases the early musical style of the band before they became influenced by the burgeoning punk scene in Iceland, and is hardly representative of their trademark avant-garde and aggressive post-punk sound which quickly followed. By late 1979 \u00DEeyr members contacted Svavar Gestsson, the owner of SG-Hlj\u00F3mpl\u00F6tur, and introduced him a few songs of disco music. Svavar sent them to studio T\u00F3nt\u00E6kni and the recording sessions began in January 1980 and were concluded in February when the band decided to take a break, which was extended until September, when the album was finished. Over the long break, new wave music was hitting Iceland and \u00DEeyr got heavily influenced by it. Therefore, part of the recorded album featured two different music styles.The album was titled \u00DEaga\u00F0 \u00ED Hel, which means Silenced to Death and it was introduced to Svavar, who felt reluctant to release it because he didn\u2019t like the music nor even the album design, but his wife, Elly Vilhj\u00E1lms (a renowned singer from the 1960s and 1970s), did like it and persuaded him to release it. Thus, \u00DEaga\u00F0 \u00ED Hel came out to the streets by December 1980, on limited edition because the vinyl printing was defected and only 500 low quality copies were released. After the release of \u00DEaga\u00F0 \u00ED Hel, \u00DEeyr gained popularity in Iceland thanks to the critic reviews and the band underwent internal changes with the departure of guitarist J\u00F3hannes Helgason and vocalist El\u00EDn Reynisd\u00F3ttir.About a year later, T\u00F3nt\u00E6kni studios were caught in a fire and the masters and all unpublished recordings of \u00DEeyr up to that moment were lost forever.The only song to survive was \"En\u2026\", which was featured on N\u00E6lur, a compilation released by label Spor in 1998. \u00DEaga\u00F0 \u00ED Hel is currently out of availability and has become a collector\u2019s item." }	, "albumType": { "type": "typed-literal", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString", "value": "studio" }	, "runtime": { "type": "typed-literal", "datatype": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#double", "value": "32.0833" }},

The crater area is covered by younger lavas and eruptives. The \u00DEj\u00F3rs\u00E1 Lava does not appear on the surface until 70 km downstream of its supposed crater area. In the lowlands of South Iceland the lava has overflown wide areas, covering the districts Landsveit, Gn\u00FApverjahreppur, Skei\u00F0 and Fl\u00F3i. The main rivers of South Iceland, \u00DEj\u00F3rs\u00E1 and Hv\u00EDt\u00E1/\u00D6lfus\u00E1, stream along the borders of the lava to the east and west and the 25 km (16 mi) long beach between the river mouths is formed by the lava. The sea level seems to have been around 15 m (49 ft) lower than today when the lava was erupted. Along with the rising sea level the ocean has transgressed the lava front so its border line is submerged several hundreds of metres off-shore and an interesting littoral zone can be inspected along the beach. The towns of Selfoss, Eyrarbakki and Stokkseyri are built on the lava. Its area is around 970 km2 (370 sq mi), the thickness 26 m (85 ft) and volume therefore close to 26 km3 (6.2 cu mi).

In fact, \"Hlava modernistova\" is the only black metal-oriented track of the entire album. Other Master's Hammer members Necrocock, Monster, Mirek Valenta and Silenthell are noticeably absent from the album; only vocalist Franta \u0160torm and keyboardist Vlasta Voral took part in its recording.

The album shows the band trying out various genres \u2013 a mix of heavy metal and progressive rock \u2013 rather than the hard rock that they would become known for on later albums. The album was generally panned by the mainstream critical press upon its release, although it has since been acknowledged as an early classic of the heavy metal genre. Rolling Stone magazine's Melissa Mills began her review by saying, \"If this group makes it I'll have to commit suicide. From the first note you know you don't want to hear any more.\" The original vinyl release was a gatefold sleeve, featuring David Byron on the front sleeve, almost unrecognisable beneath cobwebs. The album was first released on the Vertigo label in the UK, as was the follow-up Salisbury, but both were quickly reissued by Bronze when the band signed to that label. Tracks 3 and 8 were recorded as Spice songs, with Colin Wood on keyboards.
